How I envision the game:
there are different colored shapes that are falling to the ground. There are buttons with colors or shapes. Only two buttons at a time can be pressed, if a new button is pressed, oldest one is depressed. When matching shape touches the ground, it it destroyed, score is increased by 1, and a new random shape with random color is spawned above the field. 

I should be able to programatically customize lists of colors, shapes, and amount of them spawned at the start of the game. Oh, and also their size.
